Text Based Game Protocol v1.0
-----------------------------

The Text Based Game Protocol is an application layer protocol running over 
TCP, providing game controling, user controling, and other functions. In 
this document, we will specify the structure and function of the protocol. 

This document is not quite rigorous. For anything not mentioned here, please
refer to the source code.


1. The Packet Structure of TBGP
The TBGP packet structure is as follows:

        |<------ 4Bytes ------>|<-2 Bytes->|<-2 Bytes->|
        +----------------------+-----------+-----------+
		|  0x5  0x5  0xa  0xa  |  service  |  pkt_len  |
		+----------------------+-----------+-----------+
		/                     Data*                    /
		+----------------------------------------------+

* Theoretically, the data section can support 65535 bytes at most. But
practically, the data section mostly does not exceed about 1024 bytes.

All numeric fields are stored in network byte order. Aka Most significant
byte first.

0x55aa	- The first four bytes are always 0x55aa, to identify the TBGP
          packet.
service	- An opcode to tell the client/server to take proper action. The
          possible service are listed in the service section of this
		  document.
pkt_len	- A two-byte value, in network byte order, stating how many bytes
          are in the data section of the packet.
data	- The data section is pkt_len bytes long and depends on the service
          section to interpret.


2. Services

There are  known services at the moment, although more may exist. All
known services are listed below along with the hex values that they
correspond to.

		SERVICE_LOGIN		= 0x01
		SERVICE_LOGOUT		= 0x02
		SERVICE_NAMELIST	= 0x04
		SERVICE_UPDATELIST	= 0x05
		SERVICE_CHAT		= 0x08
		SERVICE_GAMEREQUEST	= 0x10
		SERVICE_GAMEON		= 0x11
		SERVICE_GAMEOP		= 0x18


3. Game Operation

When game is on the client and server will constantly exchange data and
control messages. The service of the packet is always SERVICE_GAMEOP. And
the details will be transfered in data section. The data section's structure
of gameop is as follows:

        |<-2 Bytes->|
        +-----------+------...------+------...------+
		|   OPCODE  |  User1 status |  User2 status |
		+-----------+------...------+------...------+

The details of user status will not be discussed in this document.
The opcode is specify the action of the attacker. The possible opcode is as
follows:

		GAME_PHYSICAL_ATTACK	= 0x01
		GAME_MAGICAL_ATTACK		= 0x02
		GAME_RETREAT			= 0x08
		GAME_CONCEDE			= 0x09
		GAME_WIN				= 0x10
		GAME_LOSE				= 0x11


4. Requests & Responses

4.1 Login

The first packet sent from the client is log in packet. This consists a
username whose length is 32 bytes at most.

	Service:	SERVICE_LOGIN
	Data:		Username(32 Bytes)

When a user is logged in, the server returns a series of usernames, which
represent the online users. The accurate number of names can be calculate
with pkt_len section.

	Service:	SERVICE_NAMELIST
	Data:		Username(32 Bytes)...

If there're too many online users, for example over 1820 users, the server
will send a update packet to update the name list. Client will check the
existing list and delete the repeated name and add the rest of the name.

	Service:	SERVICE_UPDATELIST
	Data:		Username(32 Bytes)...


4.2 Chat

A logged in user can send message to an online user or to all the online
users. The server's behaviour depends on the pkt_len: if pkt_len is zero,
then the server will forward the message to all the online users. Otherwise
the server will only forward to the user in the data. Theoretically the
server can forward message to a series of users.

	Service:	SERVICE_CHAT
	Data:		Username(32 Bytes)...


4.3 Fight Game

4.3.1 Game Start

When a user would like to start a game with another online user, the client
will send a game request packet to the server, which includes the username
of the rival. The server will forward the request. And the server will
forward the game on packet to tell the user the game request is accepted.

	Service:	SERVICE_GAMEREQUEST
	Data:		Username(32 Bytes)

4.3.2 Ongoing

The client and the server will constantly exchange the game operation packet
unless the game is settled or one quits.

	Service:	SERVICE_GAMEOP
	Data:		[OPCODE] [attacker's status] [defender's status]
